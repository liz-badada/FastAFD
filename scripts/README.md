# FastAFD Scripts

This directory is organized by workflow.

## Public Entry Points

Quickstart:

```bash
./scripts/quickstart/qwen3_30b_a3b_sample.sh
```

Correctness alignment:

```bash
./scripts/validate/qwen3_30b_a3b_alignment.sh
./scripts/validate/qwen3_30b_a3b_fastafd_alignment.sh
```

Large-scale AFD preset:

```bash
./scripts/experiments/afd/qwen3_30b/run_afd_qwen3_30b_a3b_fp8_3node_mb2_nsys_alignment.sh
```

Published Qwen3-235B and MiniMax M2.5 result presets live under
`scripts/experiments/afd/qwen3_235b/` and `scripts/experiments/afd/minimax_m25/`;
they dispatch through `scripts/run_afd_qwen3_30b_a3b_fp8_3node_mb2_nsys_alignment.sh`.

## Layout
